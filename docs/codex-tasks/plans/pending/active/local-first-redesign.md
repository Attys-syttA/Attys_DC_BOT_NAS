# Local-First Redesign Plan

Status: active / partly implemented

## Current Context

`Attys_DC_BOT` is now the target repository for a Windows local-first Discord-Codex bot.

The project is based on a direct local control model:

```text
Discord
  -> discord.js bot
  -> local Codex app-server / CLI
  -> local repository folder under BASE_PROJECT_DIR
  -> local SQLite state
```

## Completed

- Git repository initialized locally on branch `main`.
- Remote set to `https://github.com/Attys-syttA/Attys_DC_BOT.git`.
- TypeScript, `discord.js`, SQLite, and Vitest baseline added.
- Local-first config keys documented in `.env.example`.
- Runtime files, secrets, SQLite databases, logs, and build output are ignored.
- README, setup guide, local `AGENTS.md`, state, and changelog were rewritten for the local-first direction.
- Validation scripts are present: `typecheck`, `test`, `build`, `check`, and `secret:scan`.
- Added chadingTV-style local-first controls: `/ask`, `/doctor`, `/git-status`, and env-gated `/run-tests`.
- Added `/dashboard` as a Discord-native local Codex control center for the current channel.
- Added `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID` and `DISCORD_ENABLE_RUN_TESTS` config keys.
- Hardened attachment storage by sanitizing Discord filenames before writing into `.codex-uploads/`.
- Added repo hygiene workflows: CI, SQLite native dependency check, GitGuardian/ggshield secret scan, Dependabot, SECURITY.md, and ESLint.
- Added focused command tests for `/ask`, `/dashboard`, `/doctor`, `/git-status`, and `/run-tests`.
- Added focused Discord interaction tests for authorization, stop, queue confirm, approval, new-session, and ask-select flows.
- Refreshed npm dependencies within current major versions after Dependabot opened `tsx` and `zod` branches.

## Open

- Configure a real Discord application and local `.env`.
- Run a private Discord smoke test with a test guild.
- Decide which operator UX improvements should be added next.
- Decide whether `/usage` and `/auto-approve` should remain in the long-term canonical command set.
- Commit and push only after the user explicitly approves publication.

## Constraints

- Keep execution on the same Windows machine as Codex CLI.
- Do not add custom remote execution agents or cross-machine state sharing.
- Do not commit secrets, private paths, runtime state, or real Discord IDs.
